GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
•	a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
•	b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
•	a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
•	b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
•	a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
•	b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
•	c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
•	d) Do one of the following: 
o	0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
o	1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
•	e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
•	a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
•	b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

TRADEMARK:

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner as a trademark in any jurisdiction.

The FreeType Project License

The FreeType Project LICENSE
                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

Introduction
============

  The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;   some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the   FreeType Project.

  This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license affects thus the FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This license   was inspired by the  BSD, Artistic,  and  IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge somewhere in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of  this software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. 
  We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally  distributed by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

  `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.  This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.

  This license applies to all files distributed in the original  FreeType Project,   including all source   code, binaries and documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
  If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY   AND FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS  BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file  (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.   The copyright   notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in  all copies of source files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions apply to any software derived from or  based on the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no fee need be paid  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotionalpurposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.  As you have not signed this license, you are  not  required to accept it.   However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the  Free Type  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.      If you are looking for support,  start in  this list  if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.
